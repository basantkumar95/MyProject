What is Git?
Git is a popular version control system. 
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, 
and has been maintained by Junio Hamano 
since then.
Git is a free, open-source version control system 
(VCS) that tracks changes to projects

it is useful for coordinating work among programmers who
are colloborating developing source code during software development

git is developed in python , c ,c++ , perl ,shell script and tcl


It is used for:

   ->Tracking code changes
   ->Tracking who made changes
   ->Coding collaboration

Why Git?
Over 70% of developers use Git!
   ->Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
   ->Developers can see the full history of the project.
   ->Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.

What does Git do?
  -> Manage projects with Repositories
  -> Clone a project to work on a local copy
  -> Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
  -> Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
  -> Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
  -> Push local updates to the main project

Git is divided into three main zones
working area (untracked file)(index.html file) -> staging area (tracking area )(when we add (index.html file) it is a copy)->commit(checkpoints)
 (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

1 GIT STATUS -> Shows the current status of your working directory and staging area.
fatal: not a git repository - means this folder is not a git repository we 
have to make it a git repository

2 GIT INIT ->This command initializes a new Git repository in your project.
What it does: Creates a hidden .git folder in your project, where Git will track your files.
this .git folder Manage and trach changes all your projects and this is hidden 
3-> ls -Force -- this command is used to show all the hidden as well real files in a folder

4 GIT COMMIT command ->Saves changes in the staging area with a descriptive 
message.Saves changes in the staging area with a descriptive message.
it is basically a checkpoints that can revert
git commit -m "Your message here"
What it does: Creates a snapshot of your current changes

5 GIT ADD command->Adds files to the staging area (preparing them for commit).
Adds all changes in the current directory to the staging area.
